This plugin enables registered users to request an email notification when an out-of-stock product comes back into stock.

== Description ==

What do you do when you have no more stock of one of your products and your customers want to buy it? You risk to lose them, unless you make a system available for them to be notified of the product coming back to stock. Then, why not using a plugin that allows them to be added to a waiting list and being informed in an automatic and efficient way? This is what YITH WooCommerce Waiting List does, allowing you to loyalise them in a simple way and at the same time not lose them.

* A form to receive a reminding email when the item is back in stock
* "Add me to the waiting list" button for logged users
* Summary metabox with the number of waiting user and a rapid way to contact them
* Customization of the "Notify me" button
* Email basic template to notify users for an item back in stock
